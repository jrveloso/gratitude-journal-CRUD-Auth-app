## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose EJS

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to build out a server that could listen to and carry out CRUD requests. I also created and connected my server to a database using MongoDB. I practiced EJS, plugging data into a template and returning that to a user. Was also able to host the application on Heroku. I spent a lot of time reading MongoDB/Mongoose documents, practicing reading documentation to find answers to problems in my code.
